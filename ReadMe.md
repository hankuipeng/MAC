This folder contains the code for the **Minimum Angle Clustering (MAC)** subspace clustering algorithm. We also include the US Amazon web-scraped data using TF-IDF representation, and the code to run the real data experiment using MAC. 

Please kindly cite our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8622472) if you find the code helpful for your research.
