This folder contains the final version of the **Minimum Angle Clustering (MAC)** algorithm, and all previous development versions. We also include some experimental cluster analysis on one real data and one synthetic data, in which several clustering algorithms are applied and compared. 

Please kindly cite our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8622472) if you find the code helpful for your research.
